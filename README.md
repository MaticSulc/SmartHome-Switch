SmartHome Switch
=========

# Software
Initial ideas for product development:
- Each device has an API endpoint a user can communicate with
- Every user on the network can add those deviced to their app (security?)
- Android app that simply finds all valid hostnames 
- Web app - where to host it?
- Simple way to add devices to Google Home / Alexa / HomeKit
# Hardware design
## Initial product renders

The product idea was first designed by one of our designers in Autodesk, and was soon made into a proper PCB.

## First working product

After some development, we were soon able to print and assemble the product for early testing and development.

## Designing an enclosure

After having a first working demo, we decided to also create a custom enclosure for the item. Here are some first design renders.
